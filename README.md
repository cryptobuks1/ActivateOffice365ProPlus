# Activate Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus with this cool trick in JUST THREE steps | MANUAL Method
**Step 1: Remove your current trial license**
This step is optional if your trial license was expired. However, if it is still valid, you need to remove it. Because in some cases, after you activate your Office using KMS license, important features are resumed but the expiration notification still remains. Please follow instructions to uninstall the trial license.
Steps to remove your Office license
**Step 1:** Open command prompt as administrator
**Step 2:** Copy/run this command to determine what is the license key you want to remove.
`cscript "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospp.vbs" /dstatus`
If you see an error, try this command.
`cscript "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospp.vbs" /dstatus`
**Note:** “Office16” is codename of Office 2016. If you are using Office 2010/2013, replace “Office16” with “Office14” or “Office15”.
